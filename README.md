# Mdatools for R

## Introduction
This is an R package made for preprocessing, exploring and analyzing multivariate data, and utilizes Chemometrics methods. According to the creator of this package, 
>The general idea of the package is to collect the popular chemometric methods and give a similar “user interface” for applying the methods to different datasets. So, if a user knows how to make a model and visualize results for one method, he or she can easily do this for the other methods as well.

>dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.
